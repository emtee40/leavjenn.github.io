    <h1>The next page of Hews</h1>
    <p>Hi, this is Leav Jenn, the developer of Hews. Thanks for using this app.</p>
    <p>In the latest update, a new feature to export bookmark as .csv file was added. With this release, Hews has hit the end of development. </p>
    <p>Butâ€¦</p>
    <p>A brand new version Hews 2 is coming! Rewritten in Flutter, supports both Android and iOS, with way more features and customizable settings, and still will be open-source. You can try the beta version right now: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.leavjenn.hews2"

    <p>Thanks again for your support for all these years.</p>
